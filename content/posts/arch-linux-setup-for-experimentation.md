# Experiment with Arch using Vagrant and VirtualBox

Installing Arch on your host laptop for the first time is a leap of faith.

Described here is a setup that lets you iterate with Arch (or any other distribution) and helps you figure out through practice if you actually want to commit.


## Install and setup Vagrant

```
sudo apt install vagrant
```

```
vagrant ssh
```

## bobo

```
vagrant run arch
```

##  bobobo 

pass
